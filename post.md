## How it all Started
In 2010, when I was about 12 or 13 years old, I released my first website. It was a simple website built on an open source wall.fm website. I known nothing about development, but for some reason my website hit 634 registered users in a few month. Ever since then, I started to become more and more interested in development and used tools such as sploder or other #STEM apps to create cool games and sites. This was the beganing of what soon was to become a startup. 

After using tools that required no coding, I realized it was time to make more complicated apps. This is when I stripped my development process and started learning skills like PHP, HTML5, and Javascript. I became more interested in blog hosting platforms like Joomla, Wordpress, and Blogger. This is when my second site was born. It was a music sharing website for my (band), I was kind of an odd kid back then. 

In 2012, I started using freelance sites like Fiverr, and Odesk to make apps for other people. I didn't make much money back then, but everything I made, I put back into my business. I also started learnings skills such as app reskinning, collaborative networking, and penetration testing that made the development process more secure, quicker, or easier. 

Here I am today in 2015, with over 200 apps, numerous of websites, and an affiliate store. My point is that because of these STEM apps and because of my eagerness to learn, I have started a career in the lucrative devlopment market. This was all because I buckled down and sat hours on the desk for my new hobby.

## My Advice to you:
Always start out small in programming. Programming and Web Development isn't a quick and easy process where you get rich over night. It requires learning and memorizing many skills, it requires sitting hours on the computer, it requires an eagerness to come up with a solution to an idea or simple problem. Not every programmer is going to become like Robert Herjavec. Not every developer will make the next Fortune 100 company, or become the next million dollar startup. If your main intention to start programming is making money, then this is certainly not a career for you. 

## More Ways to Learn:
One of the best ways to learn programming is to go to coding camps for people your age. If you are an adult, then take online courses, attend seminars. The more you program the less you need to learn but the more you are able to learn. I recommend for those who already good in programming to enter a Hackathon, or try working as a consultant, always bringing your skills up to its full potential.
